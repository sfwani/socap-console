## Tools

- **KQL Queries:** Pre-built KQL hunting queries auto-filled from the CSV data. All queries are expanded by default — click a title to collapse. Fill in additional fields below to refine.
- **DHCP Lookup:** Submit a DHCP lease query to the ITC Portal in a new tab. Start Time and End Time auto-sync from the CSV.
- **Enrich IOC:** Enter an IOC to query across multiple threat intelligence sources. Select sources and open them all at once.
- **Redact:** Paste raw text/logs below. Auto-substitutes sensitive org information (IPs, emails, org names) with masked values. Add custom patterns below.
- **Header to Curl:** Paste a raw HTTP request (from browser DevTools, Burp, etc.) to convert it into a curl command.
- **HTML Analyzer:** Paste raw HTML source code or enter a URL to auto-fetch its source. Supports Wannabrowser links and direct URLs.

- **Defang:** Safely defang IOCs for sharing in reports and tickets, or refang them for active investigation. Supports multi-line input.
- **Encode/Decode:** Encode and decode payloads across common formats. Useful for analyzing obfuscated payloads, crafting queries, and sharing IOCs safely.
